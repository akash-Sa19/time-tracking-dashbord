## My process
- `Mobile-First Workflow ` I designed for small screen devices first
- then for desktop and other screen devices, with adding reponsiveness to the site 
- after the layout is ready i started styling the website with colors, fonts, icons, images etc  
- then add javascript logic or hover and data manupulation
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwindcss

### What I learned
From this challenge I learned how to properly use flex-box, flex-box is very usefull when you want to make a website responsive  

### Continued development

I am little weak at logic when it comes to JavaScript, i want to improve that by making more and more website. 

### Useful resources
